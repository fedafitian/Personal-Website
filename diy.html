                    <br />
                    Handmade gifts are always a special way to let someone know you care for them. Each present always
                    has its own unique personality with how it is wrapped and decorated. Making a gift bag will always
                    bring out the creativity in you, and will surely impress others.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You will need:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    -12x12 scrapbook paper
                    <br />
                    -paper reinforcers
                    <br />
                    -hole puncher
                    <br />
                    -ribbon
                    <br />
                    -ruler
                    <br />
                    -tape
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class=instructions>
                    <strong>Step One: </strong>Sometimes certain scrapbook papers have an extra strip with the store bar
                    code. If so, trim your scrapbook paper. Then proceed to making your gift bag. Here’s a follow along
                    with all the steps:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>Lay scrapbook paper flat</li>
                    <li>Measure 3 inches and fold.</li>
                    <li>On the opposite end, mark the 1/2 point, 6 in.</li>
                    <li>Fold both sides of paper inwards to that mark.</li>
                    <li>Tape along middle opening to enclose.</li>
                    <li>Mark on the bottom of your bag (where folds are) 3 inches.</li>
                    <li>Fold up to the 3 in. point.</li>
                    <li>Slightly open the bottom of bag.</li>
                    <li>Imitate the fold by impressing onto the side of your bag.</li>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </ol>

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>Repeat step 9 for the opposite side as well.</li>
                    <li>Fold base inwards and tape seam.</li>
                    <li>Unfold your bag and stand open.</li>
                    <li>Hole punch two holds from opposite ends 1 in from the right/left, 1 inch down.</li>
                    <li>Place paper reinforces on outside of holes, both inside and outside the bag.</li>
                    <li>Cut 2 strings of ribbon (I used 1 ft. 2 in. for each strand). String them through holes and
                        double knot.</li>
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <strong>Step Two: </strong>Not all bags are folded perfectly, like mine. There may or may not be an
                    opening to the bottom of your bag like shown below.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If so, cut out a small rectangle out of computer paper and press onto the bottom of your bag. The
                    tape should keep it from moving.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                    <br />
                    I used this bag to gift a friend delicious, fresh homemade brownies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class=instructions>
                    (Optional) Also, if you’d like to make your paper reinforcers a different color to match with your
                    scrapbook paper, you can simply color them in with a marker.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Another gift idea would be to create a coffee themed gift bag. Mom has a fancy coffee machine that
                    grinds coffee beans. I bought her favorite Starbucks flavor and placed the beans into a Starbucks
                    mug. She loved it.

                    <br />
                    <strong>Step Three: </strong>Enjoy your pretty gift bags.

                    String lights are always a great embellishment to any atmosphere. Here’s a simple way to transform
                    yours into a beautiful garland fit for any occasion/decor.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You will need:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    -tape
                    <br />
                    -ruler
                    <br />
                    -paper
                    <br />
                    -scissors
                    <br />
                    -string lights
                    <br />

                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class=instructions>
                    <strong>Step One: </strong>Gather several sheets of paper. They can be any color/texture. In case
                    you were concerned, there is no fire hazard with LED lights (the bulbs used for most string lights).
                    Any paper will do!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>

                <br />

                <p class="instructions">
                    I went ahead with white, normal computer paper. You want to use your ruler to mark an 8.5 by 8.5
                    square. This will be the best size to use when making “origami balloons” (the paper cubes).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <strong>Step Two: </strong>Go ahead and begin your folds. Here’s a follow-along with all the steps.

                    <br />
                    <li>Grab an 8.5 by 8.5 sheet of paper.</li>
                    <li>Create a diagonal fold.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 2 in the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li>Create a horizontal fold.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 4 in the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li>Bend the folds at running through the corners of the paper.</li>
                    <li>Naturally fold it into a triangle (naturally as in, the creases have been already made).</li>
                    <li>Fold the right and left top flaps inward towards the top of the triangle.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 8 on the opposite side.</li>
                    <li>Fold the right and top flap inward towards the middle fold of your diamond-shaped paper.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 10 for the remainder 3 sides.</li>
                    <li>Fold outward the bottom left top flap.</li>
                    <li>Fold flap inward.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 12-13 for the remainder 3 sides.</li>
                    <li>Unfold your balloon partially.</li>
                    <li>Inflate balloon by blowing in the opening on top gently.</li>
                    <li>Notice the outward flaps.</li>
                    <li>Tape the flaps to create a sturdier paper balloon.</li>

                    Eventually these will become addictive to make and you will watch them pile up.

                    <strong>Step Three: </strong>After you have made as many origami balloons as desired, gather your
                    string of lights.
                    <br />

                    <strong>Step One: </strong>Print out an outline of a USA map. If a printer is unavailable, you can
                    easily transfer the outline using the technique below.
                    <br />

                    <em>DIY Tracing Pad: </em>Take a sheet of paper and lay it flat against your computer monitor. The
                    brightness coming from the screen creates a trace pad and you’ll be able to see the outline. Using a
                    pencil, trace gently until the outline is complete.

                    <strong>Step Two: </strong>Go ahead and begin transforming your cork board into a USA map. Here’s a
                    follow-along with all the steps.

                    <br />
                    <li>Use a black sharpie to darken the outer outline of the map. Use a black colored pencil to darken the inner outlines of the states. (Please don’t forget Hawaii & Alaska!!)</li>
                    <li>Cut along the outer outlines of the map.</li>
                    <li>Place map onto cork board. Using a black sharpie, trace along the outline to transfer onto board.</li>
                    <li>Using an X-Acto knife, cut along inner outlines of states.</li>
                    <li>Fold/remove states one by one.</li>
                    <li>Trace their outlines with a sharpie.
                        <br/>
                            (I used the point of a pencil to jab into the map so the map would stay put as I traced the outlines. It was much sturdier than a thumb tack.)</li>
                    <li>Go over outline once more with sharpie.</li>
                    <li>Cut along outline.</li>
                    <li>Begin painting. Make sure to apply two layers of paint to each state for a more solid color.</li>
                    <li>Use a sharpie to go over inner and outer outlines of map.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 10 for the remainder 3 sides.</li>
                    <li>Grab the top cover of an 11 by 11 shoe box.</li>
                    <li>Attach a scrapbook sheet of paper by using a glue stick.</li>
                    <li>Attach map using double sided adhesive or a hot glue gun.</li>
                    <li>Hang your shoe box using two thumb tacks. Proceed using thumb tacks to mark places visited.</li>
                    <li>(optional) Using a sharpie or letter stickers, draw out a saying/title.</li>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <strong>Step Three: </strong>Enjoy marking your vacation spots!
